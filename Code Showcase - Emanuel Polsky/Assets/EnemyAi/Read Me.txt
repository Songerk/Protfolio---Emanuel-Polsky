The main focus of this category is:

the Escape sequence of the enemy-
in the script "EscapeToHideSpotDuckState",
the sequence is based on stages of 
1.Be Surprised by the Player
2.Running in the opposite direction of the player
3.Running in a zigzag pattern 
4.After running far enough away from the player, look for the nearest hiding place.
5.Checking to see if there are any enemies or players nearby.
6.Running to the Selected Hidden Location
7.Stopping at the hidden spot
8.If the player is nearby, he will hide in the opposite direction to avoid being seen by the player.
9.If the enemy notices the player, the sequence will restart.
10.If he does not notice the player after a certain amount of time, he will run to his final position to escape the area.



the Alert Mechanic and the Field Of View Mechanic - 
The Alert is divided into five stages: idea, alert, fleeing, running to hide spot, and hiding.
that changed as a result of:
1.what the enemy sees in specific radius and angle
2. Will mimicking hearing depend on the player's distance from him and his rate of movement
3. detecting a player's proximity.
